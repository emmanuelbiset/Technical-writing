# Track the Planetary State Change
You're monitoring a critical system transition. Here's your baseline data.
## Key Metrics (2020-2024)
## Material accumulation:
- Technosphere mass now exceeds planetary biomass (2020 threshold)
- Plastic production: 200M → 430M tons
- E-waste: 20M → 62M tons
## Atmospheric state:
- CO2: 369 ppm (2000) → 423 ppm (2024)
- Data center consumption: 200 TWh/year (2010) → 460 TWh/year (2022)
- Note: AI workloads not yet factored in
## Network growth:
- Connected devices: 400M (2000) → 27B (2025)
## Resource extraction:
- Natural resources: 54B tons (2000) → 100B tons (2022)
- Vertebrate populations: -69% (WWF Living Planet Index, 2000-2022)
## Additional markers:
- Persistent pollutants accumulating
- Atmospheric microplastics detected
- Pharmaceuticals in environment
## Your Task
Don't apply legacy frameworks to new conditions. The system changed. Your theories must change too.
## What this book does:
- Maps theoretical approaches to four domains: climate, technology, economy, politics
- Identifies patterns in contemporary theory
- Provides navigation for specific concerns or overview

**Core principle**: You can't debug a transformed system with outdated tools. Build new models for the current state.
